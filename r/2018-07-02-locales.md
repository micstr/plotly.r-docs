### Setting Locale
To change the localization, you can use the `locale` argument in the `config()` function. 


```r
library(plotly)

x <- seq.Date(Sys.Date(), Sys.Date() + 360, by = "day")

fig <- plot_ly(x = x, y = rnorm(length(x))) 
fig <- fig %>%
   add_lines() 
fig <- fig %>%
  config(locale = 'zh-CN')
```

### Reference

See `?plotly::config` for more information about config options or [click here](https://plotly.com/r/configuration-options/). For more information regarding localization, [click here](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/tree/master/dist#to-include-localization).
### What About Dash?

[Dash for R](https://dashr.plot.ly/) is an open-source framework for building analytical applications, with no Javascript required, and it is tightly integrated with the Plotly graphing library. 

Learn about how to install Dash for R at https://dashr.plot.ly/installation.

Everywhere in this page that you see `fig`, you can display the same figure in a Dash for R application by passing it to the `figure` argument of the [`Graph` component](https://dashr.plot.ly/dash-core-components/graph) from the built-in `dashCoreComponents` package like this:


```r
library(plotly)

fig <- plot_ly() 
# fig <- fig %>% add_trace( ... )
# fig <- fig %>% layout( ... ) 

library(dash)
library(dashCoreComponents)
library(dashHtmlComponents)

app <- Dash$new()
app$layout(
    htmlDiv(
        list(
            dccGraph(figure=fig) 
        )
     )
)

app$run_server(debug=TRUE, dev_tools_hot_reload=FALSE)
```
