### Mapbox Access Token

To plot on Mapbox maps with Plotly you *may* need a Mapbox account and a public [Mapbox Access Token](https://www.mapbox.com/studio). See our [Mapbox Map Layers](/r/mapbox-layers/) documentation for more information. If you're using a Chart Studio Enterprise server, please see additional instructions [here](https://help.plot.ly/mapbox-atlas).

### Lines on Mapbox maps using "Scattermapbox" traces

To draw a line on your map, you either can use [Scattermapbox](https://plotly.com/r/reference/#scattermapbox) or [scattergeo](https://plotly.com/r/reference/#scattergeo) trace type in plotly. This example uses scattermapbox and defines the drawing [mode](https://plotly.com/python/reference/#scattermapbox-mode) to the combination of markers and line.


```r
library(plotly)

fig <- plot_ly(
  type = 'scattermapbox',
  mode = "markers+lines",
  lon = c(10, 20, 30),
  lat = c(10, 20,30),
  marker = list(size = 10)) 
fig <- fig %>%
  add_trace(
    type = 'scattermapbox',
    mode = "markers+lines",
    lon = c(-50, -60,40),
    lat = c(30, 10, -20),
    marker = list(size = 10)) 
fig <- fig %>%
  layout(
    mapbox = list(
      style = "stamen-terrain",
      center = list(lon = 10, lat= 10),
      zoom = 1),
    margin =list(l=0,t=0,b=0,r=0))

fig
```

### What About Dash?

[Dash for R](https://dashr.plot.ly/) is an open-source framework for building analytical applications, with no Javascript required, and it is tightly integrated with the Plotly graphing library. 

Learn about how to install Dash for R at https://dashr.plot.ly/installation.

Everywhere in this page that you see `fig`, you can display the same figure in a Dash for R application by passing it to the `figure` argument of the [`Graph` component](https://dashr.plot.ly/dash-core-components/graph) from the built-in `dashCoreComponents` package like this:


```r
library(plotly)

fig <- plot_ly() 
# fig <- fig %>% add_trace( ... )
# fig <- fig %>% layout( ... ) 

library(dash)
library(dashCoreComponents)
library(dashHtmlComponents)

app <- Dash$new()
app$layout(
    htmlDiv(
        list(
            dccGraph(figure=fig) 
        )
     )
)

app$run_server(debug=TRUE, dev_tools_hot_reload=FALSE)
```
