### Style Axes Ticks and Placement


```r
library(plotly)
a <- list(
  autotick = FALSE,
  ticks = "outside",
  tick0 = 0,
  dtick = 0.25,
  ticklen = 5,
  tickwidth = 2,
  tickcolor = toRGB("blue")
)
s <- seq(1, 4, by = 0.25)
fig <- plot_ly(x = ~s, y = ~s)
fig <- fig %>% layout(xaxis = a, yaxis = a)

fig
```

### Style Axes Titles and Ticks Labels


```r
library(plotly)
f1 <- list(
  family = "Arial, sans-serif",
  size = 18,
  color = "lightgrey"
)
f2 <- list(
  family = "Old Standard TT, serif",
  size = 14,
  color = "black"
)
a <- list(
  title = "AXIS TITLE",
  titlefont = f1,
  showticklabels = TRUE,
  tickangle = 45,
  tickfont = f2,
  exponentformat = "E"
)

s <- seq(1e6, 1e7, length.out = 10)
fig <- plot_ly(x = ~s, y = ~s)
fig <- fig %>% add_markers()
fig <- fig %>% add_markers(y = ~rev(s))
fig <- fig %>% layout(xaxis = a, yaxis = a, showlegend = FALSE)

fig

### Style Axes and Zero-Lines

```r
library(plotly)
ax <- list(
  zeroline = TRUE,
  showline = TRUE,
  mirror = "ticks",
  gridcolor = toRGB("gray50"),
  gridwidth = 2,

  linecolor = toRGB("black"),
  linewidth = 6

s <- seq(-1, 4)
fig <- plot_ly(x = ~s, y = ~s)
fig <- fig %>% layout(xaxis = ax, yaxis = ax)

### Hide Axes Title, Lines, Ticks, and Labels

```r
library(plotly)
ax <- list(
  title = "",
  zeroline = FALSE,
  showline = FALSE,
  showticklabels = FALSE,
  showgrid = FALSE
)

fig <- plot_ly(x = c(1, 2), y = c(1, 2))
fig <- fig %>% layout(xaxis = ax, yaxis = ax)

### Reversed Axes

```r

### Reversed Axes with Range ( Min/Max ) Specified

```r
library(plotly)
x <- seq(0, 10, length=50)
y <- runif(n = 50, min = 0, max = 10)

fig <- plot_ly(x = x, y = y)
fig <- fig %>% layout(xaxis = list(range = c(10, 0)))

### What About Dash?

[Dash for R](https://dashr.plot.ly/) is an open-source framework for building analytical applications, with no Javascript required, and it is tightly integrated with the Plotly graphing library. 

Learn about how to install Dash for R at https://dashr.plot.ly/installation.

Everywhere in this page that you see `fig`, you can display the same figure in a Dash for R application by passing it to the `figure` argument of the [`Graph` component](https://dashr.plot.ly/dash-core-components/graph) from the built-in `dashCoreComponents` package like this:


```r
library(plotly)

fig <- plot_ly() 
# fig <- fig %>% add_trace( ... )
# fig <- fig %>% layout( ... ) 

library(dash)
library(dashCoreComponents)
library(dashHtmlComponents)

app <- Dash$new()
app$layout(
    htmlDiv(
        list(
            dccGraph(figure=fig) 
        )
     )
)

app$run_server(debug=TRUE, dev_tools_hot_reload=FALSE)
```
