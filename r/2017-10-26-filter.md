#### Basic Example


```r
library(plotly)

fig <- plot_ly(
  type = 'scatter',
  x = mtcars$hp,
  y = mtcars$qsec,
  text = rownames(mtcars),
  hoverinfo = 'text',
  mode = 'markers',
  transforms = list(
    list(
      type = 'filter',
      target = 'y',
      operation = '>',
      value = mean(mtcars$qsec)
    )
  )
)

fig
```

### What About Dash?

[Dash for R](https://dashr.plot.ly/) is an open-source framework for building analytical applications, with no Javascript required, and it is tightly integrated with the Plotly graphing library. 

Learn about how to install Dash for R at https://dashr.plot.ly/installation.

Everywhere in this page that you see `fig`, you can display the same figure in a Dash for R application by passing it to the `figure` argument of the [`Graph` component](https://dashr.plot.ly/dash-core-components/graph) from the built-in `dashCoreComponents` package like this:


```r
library(plotly)

fig <- plot_ly() 
# fig <- fig %>% add_trace( ... )
# fig <- fig %>% layout( ... ) 

library(dash)
library(dashCoreComponents)
library(dashHtmlComponents)

app <- Dash$new()
app$layout(
    htmlDiv(
        list(
            dccGraph(figure=fig) 
        )
     )
)

app$run_server(debug=TRUE, dev_tools_hot_reload=FALSE)
```
