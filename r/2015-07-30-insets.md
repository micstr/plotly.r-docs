```r
library(plotly)
fig <- plotly::plot_ly()
fig <- plotly::add_trace(fig, x = c(1, 2, 3), y = c(4, 3, 2), mode='lines')
fig <- plotly::add_trace(fig, x = c(20, 30, 40), y = c(30, 40, 50), xaxis='x2', yaxis='y2', mode='lines')
fig <- plotly::layout(fig, xaxis2 = list(domain = c(0.6, 0.95), anchor='y2'),
         yaxis2 = list(domain = c(0.6, 0.95), anchor='x2'))
         
fig

### What About Dash?

[Dash for R](https://dashr.plot.ly/) is an open-source framework for building analytical applications, with no Javascript required, and it is tightly integrated with the Plotly graphing library. 

Learn about how to install Dash for R at https://dashr.plot.ly/installation.

Everywhere in this page that you see `fig`, you can display the same figure in a Dash for R application by passing it to the `figure` argument of the [`Graph` component](https://dashr.plot.ly/dash-core-components/graph) from the built-in `dashCoreComponents` package like this:


```r
library(plotly)

fig <- plot_ly() 
# fig <- fig %>% add_trace( ... )
# fig <- fig %>% layout( ... ) 

library(dash)
library(dashCoreComponents)
library(dashHtmlComponents)

app <- Dash$new()
app$layout(
    htmlDiv(
        list(
            dccGraph(figure=fig) 
        )
     )
)

app$run_server(debug=TRUE, dev_tools_hot_reload=FALSE)
```
