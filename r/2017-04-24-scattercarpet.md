### Basic Carpet Plot


```r
library(plotly)

fig <- plot_ly(
    type = 'carpet',
    a = c(4, 4, 4, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6),
    b = c(1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3),
    y = c(2, 3.5, 4, 3, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 10),
    aaxis = list(
      tickprefix = 'a = ',
      ticksuffix = 'm',
      smoothing = 1,
      minorgridcount = 9
      ),
    baxis = list(
      tickprefix = 'b = ',
      ticksuffix = 'Pa',
      smoothing = 1,
      minorgridcount = 9
      )
    )

### Add Carpet Scatter Trace


```r

    y = c(2, 3.5, 4, 3, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 10),
    aaxis = list(

      ticksuffix = 'Pa',
      smoothing = 1,
      minorgridcount = 9
      )
    )

    a = c(4, 4.5, 5, 6),
    b = c(2.5, 2.5, 2.5, 2.5),
    line = list(

### What About Dash?

[Dash for R](https://dashr.plot.ly/) is an open-source framework for building analytical applications, with no Javascript required, and it is tightly integrated with the Plotly graphing library. 

Learn about how to install Dash for R at https://dashr.plot.ly/installation.

Everywhere in this page that you see `fig`, you can display the same figure in a Dash for R application by passing it to the `figure` argument of the [`Graph` component](https://dashr.plot.ly/dash-core-components/graph) from the built-in `dashCoreComponents` package like this:


```r
library(plotly)

fig <- plot_ly() 
# fig <- fig %>% add_trace( ... )
# fig <- fig %>% layout( ... ) 

library(dash)
library(dashCoreComponents)
library(dashHtmlComponents)

app <- Dash$new()
app$layout(
    htmlDiv(
        list(
            dccGraph(figure=fig) 
        )
     )
)

app$run_server(debug=TRUE, dev_tools_hot_reload=FALSE)
```
