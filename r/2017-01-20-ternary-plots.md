### Basic Ternary Plot with Markers


```r
library(plotly)

journalist <- c(75,70,75,5,10,10,20,10,15,10,20)
developer <- c(25,10,20,60,80,90,70,20,5,10,10)
designer <- c(0,20,5,35,10,0,10,70,80,80,70)
label <- c('point 1','point 2','point 3','point 4','point 5','point 6',
           'point 7','point 8','point 9','point 10','point 11')


df <- data.frame(journalist,developer,designer,label)

# axis layout
axis <- function(title) {
  list(
    title = title,
    titlefont = list(
      size = 20
    ),
    tickfont = list(
      size = 15
    ),
    tickcolor = 'rgba(0,0,0,0)',
    ticklen = 5
  )
}


fig <- df %>% plot_ly()
fig <- fig %>% add_trace(
    type = 'scatterternary',
    mode = 'markers',
    a = ~journalist,
    b = ~developer,
    c = ~designer,
    text = ~label,
    marker = list( 
      symbol = 100,
      color = '#DB7365',
      size = 14,
      line = list('width' = 2)
    )
  )
fig <- fig %>% layout(
    title = "Simple Ternary Plot with Markers",
    ternary = list(
      sum = 100,
      aaxis = axis('Journalist'),
      baxis = axis('Developer'),
      caxis = axis('Designer')
    )
  )

fig

### What About Dash?

[Dash for R](https://dashr.plot.ly/) is an open-source framework for building analytical applications, with no Javascript required, and it is tightly integrated with the Plotly graphing library. 

Learn about how to install Dash for R at https://dashr.plot.ly/installation.

Everywhere in this page that you see `fig`, you can display the same figure in a Dash for R application by passing it to the `figure` argument of the [`Graph` component](https://dashr.plot.ly/dash-core-components/graph) from the built-in `dashCoreComponents` package like this:


```r
library(plotly)

fig <- plot_ly() 
# fig <- fig %>% add_trace( ... )
# fig <- fig %>% layout( ... ) 

library(dash)
library(dashCoreComponents)
library(dashHtmlComponents)

app <- Dash$new()
app$layout(
    htmlDiv(
        list(
            dccGraph(figure=fig) 
        )
     )
)

app$run_server(debug=TRUE, dev_tools_hot_reload=FALSE)
```
